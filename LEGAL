Fatigue ('the App') is provided by the International Airborne Geophysics Survey Association (IAGSA) free of charge to its members as a tool for their pilots and flight crews to assess their personal fatigue levels before starting their work day. The App is provided 'as is', without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied, for fitness towards the stated purpose, or any others.  As freeware, others may use the App but hereby acknowledge that the App may not be fit for their purpose.  In no event shall IAGSA, a not-for-profit organisation incorporated under the laws of Ontario, Canada be liable to any person or company for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages.

ADVISORY:  Regardless of the score output by the App, if the user has or knows of any reason why they should not operate or work on their aircraft (or other vehicle type for non-IAGSA members), then the user is hereby advised not to work on their aircraft or other vehicle-type for that day.
